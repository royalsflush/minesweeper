# # Minesweeper

This is a very simple homage to the Windows-style Minesweeper that came with
older versions.

It will have the following features:

* Choose difficulty (easy, medium, hard, custom)
  * Easy is 10x10 with 10 bombs
  * Medium is 16x16 with X bombs
  * Hard is 30x16 with Y bombs
  * Custom allows you to pick size and bomb density
* Interface has a timer, a count of bombs left and a smiley face
  * Timer on the right
  * Count of bombs on the left
  * Smiley face in the middle, starts a new game when you click it
* For the preset levels, we want an arcade-style leaderboard (username)
* Layout of the page is a two column one
  * Minesweeper on the left
  * Leaderboard on the right, and in narrow pages it goes under (which should
  be the default)

The deployed version is minesweeper.royalsflush.com
